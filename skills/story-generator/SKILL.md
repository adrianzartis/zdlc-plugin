# Story Generator Skill

Automatically generates high-quality user stories following INVEST principles and agile best practices.

## When I Activate

I activate automatically when you:
- Say "create user stories from..."
- Mention "break down this epic/feature"
- Ask to "generate stories for..."
- Reference a PRD and want stories
- Say "turn these requirements into stories"
- Mention "write acceptance criteria"

## What I Do

1. **Analyze Input**
   - Read PRD, requirements doc, or epic description
   - Identify functional and non-functional requirements
   - Understand user personas and goals
   - Note technical constraints

2. **Generate Stories**
   - Follow INVEST principles rigorously
   - Create independent, valuable stories
   - Size appropriately (1-8 points)
   - Ensure testability

3. **Write Acceptance Criteria**
   - Use Given-When-Then format
   - Cover happy path + edge cases
   - Include error handling scenarios
   - Specify UI behavior explicitly
   - Define validation rules

4. **Add Technical Details**
   - Implementation hints
   - Performance requirements
   - Security considerations
   - Accessibility notes

5. **Map Dependencies**
   - Identify blocking relationships
   - Note technical dependencies
   - Flag external dependencies

6. **(Optional) Push to ADO**
   - Create stories in Azure DevOps
   - Link to parent epic/feature
   - Add appropriate tags
   - Set initial priority

## Story Quality Standards

Every story I generate:
- ✅ **Independent**: Can be developed in any order
- ✅ **Negotiable**: Implementation details flexible
- ✅ **Valuable**: Delivers clear user benefit
- ✅ **Estimable**: Team can size it
- ✅ **Small**: Fits in one sprint
- ✅ **Testable**: Clear pass/fail criteria

## Acceptance Criteria Format

I always use Given-When-Then:

```
#### AC1: User successfully filters orders by date
**Given** I am on the order history page
**When** I select date range "Jan 1 - Jan 31" and click "Apply"
**Then** Only orders from January are displayed
**And** Order count shows "Showing 45 of 1,234 orders"
**And** URL updates to include filter parameters
```

## Story Sizing

I estimate based on complexity:
- **1-2 points**: Simple changes, clear path
- **3-5 points**: Standard feature, moderate complexity
- **8 points**: Complex feature, multiple components
- **>8 points**: I break it down further

## Example Output

Given requirement: "Users need to filter orders by date range"

I generate:

```markdown
## Story 001: Date Range Filter for Order History

**As an** operations manager
**I want to** filter order history by selecting a date range
**So that** I can quickly find orders from specific time periods

### Story Points: 5

### Priority: High

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Date picker UI is displayed
**Given** I am on the order history page
**When** I click the "Filter by Date" button
**Then** A date range picker appears with "From" and "To" fields
**And** Today's date is set as default

#### AC2: Filter applies successfully
**Given** I have selected dates (Jan 1 - Jan 31)
**When** I click "Apply Filter"
**Then** Only orders within that range are shown
**And** Order count updates to reflect filtered results
**And** Page URL includes filter parameters

#### AC3: Invalid date range is prevented
**Given** I am selecting a date range
**When** I select "To" date before "From" date
**Then** I see error: "End date must be after start date"
**And** "Apply Filter" button is disabled

#### AC4: Filter can be cleared
**Given** A date filter is applied
**When** I click "Clear Filter"
**Then** All orders are displayed
**And** Date picker is reset

#### AC5: Filter persists on page refresh
**Given** I have applied a date filter
**When** I refresh the page
**Then** The filter remains applied
**And** Filtered results are displayed

### Technical Notes
- Use date-fns v3 for date manipulation
- Store filter in URL query params
- Client-side filtering for <1000 orders
- Server-side for >1000 orders
- Cache results for 5 minutes

### Dependencies
- Blocks: Story 003 (Export needs filter context)
- Requires: Date picker component from design system

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for all ACs
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Performance: Filter < 200ms
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

## Handling Different Inputs

### From PRD
I extract all functional requirements and create a story for each significant capability.

### From Epic
I break down the epic into 5-12 stories, ensuring complete coverage.

### From Interview Notes
I synthesize user needs into value-driven stories with clear rationale.

### From Bug Reports
I create stories for fixes, improvements, or preventive measures.

## Validation

Before outputting stories, I validate:
- Each story delivers user value
- Acceptance criteria are testable
- Story size is appropriate
- No tight coupling between stories
- All edge cases covered
- Error handling specified

## Azure DevOps Integration

If requested, I can push stories directly to ADO:
- Create work items with all details
- Link to parent epic/feature
- Set priority and tags
- Assign to backlog or sprint
- Include links to designs

## Tips for Best Results

Give me:
- Clear requirements or PRD
- Target story point range
- Any specific technical constraints
- Links to Figma designs
- Priority guidance

I'll generate stories ready for sprint planning!
